# collaborative-product-ledger

Radix DLT Blueprint for developing products with collaborative ownership of commercial profits according to individual "product contributions" (e.g. "time" spent on a project).

The Scypto component CollaborativeProduct can be used to define a smart contract for this kind of ownership.
